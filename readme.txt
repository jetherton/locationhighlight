description: Lets users pick from a drop down list the administrative areas they are looking for and it highlights them on the map. The plugin also lets you define cities that can fall under any and all admin areas. If a user selects one of these cities the map will be centered on it, and the current admin areas and city name will be used to populate the location name field in Ushahidi.

== Description ==
When users are adding new reports to the map they may struggle to find landmarks or administrative boundaries that make it easier
for them to contextualize what they're looking at and figure out where they need to put the marker. This program will let users
pick from a dropdown list the administative area they are looking for. They can then focous on that area of the map

Special thanks to Rob Baker for adding some attractive CSS.
