Description
-----------------
When users are adding new reports to the map they may struggle to find landmarks or administrative boundaries that make it easier
for them to contextualize what they're looking at and figure out where they need to put the marker. This program will let users
pick from a dropdown list the administative area they are looking for. They can then focous on that area of the map

Special thanks to Rob Baker for adding some attractive CSS.
